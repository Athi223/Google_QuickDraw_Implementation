Explained all about Quick Draw -

â€¢ Architecture

â€¢ Data Pre-Processing and Data Manipulation

â€¢ Activation Functions ( RELU and Sigmoid )

â€¢ Convolutional Neural Network

â€¢ Max Pooling

â€¢ Fully Connected Layers

â€¢ Flaterning

Note - If Computational power is not enough to train the model on 10-12 Doodled images or .npy files.
